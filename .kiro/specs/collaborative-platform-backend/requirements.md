# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive backend system for a collaborative platform similar to Solvearn.net. The platform will enable users to create and manage projects, form teams, participate in competitions, and collaborate in real-time. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js with JWT authentication, MongoDB/MySQL for data storage, and RESTful APIs for frontend integration.
